# Tealbook Assignment

This project was set as an assignment for [tealbook](https://www.tealbook.com/).

### Main Criteria

- Enter a valid city into a text field and show the 7-day weather forecast of that city
- Show an image depicting the state of the weather for each day. For example: snowing, raining, sunny, etc...
- Save the last 5 searches and allow users to select any of them to show the 7-day weather forecast
- In the corner of the screen, display the current weather of the city where the user is and update this weather with the latest value every 5 minutes
- If there is a city selected, display the difference in the weather between the user's city and the selected city

### Other Requirements:

- Use react (create-react-app)
- Use Typescript
- Use redux or recoil to manage the global state of the app
- Write unit test for at least 2 of the components, use https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/
- Make it look pretty: use something like material-ui, or bootstrap

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
